---Smart Irrigation System---

Project Description:
Welcome to the Smart Irrigation System project!
This innovative project aims to optimize water usage for agricultural and gardening purposes through automated irrigation systems.
Our goal is to create an efficient, scalable, and cost-effective solution that leverages modern technologies to ensure sustainable water management.

Key Features:

Automated Irrigation: Uses soil moisture sensors to monitor soil conditions and automatically adjust water levels.
Weather Integration: Integrates weather forecasts to prevent over-irrigation during rainy periods.
Remote Monitoring: Provides real-time data on soil moisture and irrigation status via a user-friendly web or mobile interface.
Customizable Schedules: Allows users to set specific watering schedules based on plant types and growth stages.
Energy Efficiency: Powered by solar panels to reduce environmental impact and operational costs.

Technologies Used:

Hardware: Soil moisture sensors, water pump, microcontroller i.e. Arduino.
Software:  C , Blynk IOT app.
